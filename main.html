                <h2>Cartea 1</h2>
                
                <p>In timpul vizitei lui Socrate in Pireu, in casa Cephalus, un batran fabricant de arme, sunt propuse 2 definitii ale justitiei, care ulterior vor fi considerate necorespunzatoare:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Restituirea datoriilor</strong> </li>

                    <li> <strong>Ajutorarea prietenilor si facerea de rau a dusmanilor</strong> </li>
                </ul>
                <br> Aceste definitii nu vor fi respinse complet, Socrate considerand ca ajutarea prietenilor face parte dintr-o definitie corectă a justitiei. Acesta  este contrazis de Thrasymachus care afirma ca justitia este "ce este cel mai bine pentru cei puternici", referindu-se la faptul ca cei aflati in putere actioneaza ca o sursa a dreptatii in cetate. Socrate respinge aceasta definitie, subliniind faptul ca un conducator ar putea da o lege ce i-ar diminua binele.

                <h2>Cartea 2</h2>
                While visiting the Piraeus with Glaucon, Polemarchus tells Socrates to join him for a romp. Socrates then asks Cephalus, Polemarchus, and Thrasymachus their definitions of justice. Cephalus defines justice as giving what is owed. Polemarchus says justice is "the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies." Thrasymachus proclaims "justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger." Socrates overturns their definitions and says that it is to one's advantage to be just and disadvantage to be unjust. The first book ends in aporia concerning its essence.
